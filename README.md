Growth in residential demand forecast for 2021, with a slight realignment in prices. The multifamily housing segment is expected to be positive in 2021, driven by increased demand forecasts and strong investor interest. (CBRE.es)



### **Tableau Data Dashboard**

Dashboards are powerful tools for communicating important information __at-a-glance__. The goal was to build a data dashboard using our scraped dataset.
You can access the Public Tableau Dashboard using this [Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/manuel1108#!/vizhome/FP_DataViz_Real_Estate_Madrid_100pct_data_with_Coordinates/RealEstateMadrid)

The main objective was to build a dashboard to help understand the basics of the residential real estate market.
